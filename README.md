**RustedCraft** is a Minecraft-inspired game built from scratch using **Rust**. It combines elements of **voxel-based world generation**, **block manipulation**, and a **custom graphics pipeline** to provide a unique and performance-oriented gameplay experience. This project explores the potential of game development with Rust and showcases modern OpenGL graphics.

> [!WARNING]
> **WIP**: This project is still a work in progress. Some features are not fully implemented.

## 🎮 Features
